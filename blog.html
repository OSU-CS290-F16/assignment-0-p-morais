			<p> <h6> First Assignment </h6> This assignment was pretty straightforward. All it took was a review of W3. <br> The most helpful 
					resource is always googling the relevant HTML tag which usually <br> yields a link to W3Schools with the W3C specification. 
					It's pretty straightforward to go from there.</p>
